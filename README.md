# Final Greenfoot Project
This is Justin's "Falling Pizza" game. The objective is to eat as many pizzas as you can in a 60 second duration. There are pizzas and apples spawining at random locations on the top of the world. The speed of the apples and pizzas will progressively get faster as you eat more pizzas. If you touch the apples, the game is over early. If you make it to the 60 second mark, the game is over and the end screen lets you know how many pizzas you have ate.
